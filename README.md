# Password simulation with a 4x4 keypad library

1. Get the library i'm using at <https://github.com/Alpinine99/Arduino-keypad-library>

2. For some reason the arduino ide2 does not allow manipulation of the text on the serial monitor so I used the vscode extension of microsoft serial monitor in the case of deleting already input text.

3. Hook up the circuit as in the declaration of the sketch, open the vscode serial monitor and test the code.
